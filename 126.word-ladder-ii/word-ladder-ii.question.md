
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that:


Only one letter can be changed at a time
Each intermediate word must exist in the word list



For example,


Given:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]


Return

  [
    ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
    ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
  ]




Note:

All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
