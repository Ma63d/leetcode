
Given a set of candidate numbers (C) (without duplicates) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T. 


The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.


Note:

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.




For example, given candidate set [2, 3, 6, 7] and target 7, 
A solution set is: 

[
  [7],
  [2, 2, 3]
]
