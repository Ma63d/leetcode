
Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.


For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.


For example:
Given the below binary tree,

       1
      / \
     2   3



Return 6.
