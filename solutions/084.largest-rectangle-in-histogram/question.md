
Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.




Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].




The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.



For example,
Given heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3],
return 10.
