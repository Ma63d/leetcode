Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.


For "(()", the longest valid parentheses substring is "()", which has length = 2.


Another example is ")()())", where the longest valid parentheses substring is "()()", which has length = 4.
