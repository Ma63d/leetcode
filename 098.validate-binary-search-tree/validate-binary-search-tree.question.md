
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).



Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.



Example 1:

    2
   / \
  1   3

Binary tree [2,1,3], return true.


Example 2:

    1
   / \
  2   3

Binary tree [1,2,3], return false.
